DESCRIPTION
    Plantuml is a library for generating UML diagrams from a simple text
    markup language.

    This is a simple Perl remote client interface to a plantuml server using
    the same custom encoding used by most other plantuml clients. Perl was
    missing from the list.

    There are other plantuml Perl libraries, like
    PlantUML::ClassDiagram::Parse, they provide only parsing capabilities
    for Class Diagrams. In contrast WWW::PlantUML module provides accessing
    any UML Diagram Type in various formats supported by any plantUML server
    via HTTP Protocol.

    This client defaults to the public plantuml server, but can be used
    against any server.

    Can be optionally passed a URL to the PlantUML Server.

    Defaults to http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml

  fetch_url
    First parameter is PlantUML Syntax as a String.

    Optionally second parameter is the format of the generated diagram as a
    String.
