WWW-PlantUML

Plantuml is a library for generating UML diagrams from a simple text markup language.

This is a simple Perl remote client interface to a plantuml server using the same custom encoding used by most other plantuml clients. Perl was missing from the list.

There are other plantuml Perl libraries, like PlantUML::ClassDiagram::Parse, they provide only parsing capabilities for Class Diagrams. In contrast WWW::PlantUML module provides accessing any UML Diagram Type in various formats supported by any plantUML server via HTTP Protocol.

This client defaults to the public plantuml server, but can be used against any server.
